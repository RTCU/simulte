- Significant changes had to be introduced when updating the simulte sources in order to be able to
  run with INET 4. All simulations within the simulations subfolder are runnable again. 
  However, a thorough comparison of the simulation results obtained with the INET 3 based version
  still needs to be done.

- use signal based statistics. In some places forwarded/dropped packets are counted inside a module.
  These can be replaced by simply emitting the given packet.

- In LteBinder parameters for QCI 3 4 and 6 7 seems to be swapped ???
